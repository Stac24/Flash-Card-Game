# Flash-Card-Game

Description:

A Flash Card Game! This project was created for the [OSU Spring Hackathon](https://www.beaverhacks.com/). 

The team is comprised of [Andrew](https://github.com/adnjoo), [Stephanie](https://github.com/Stac24), [Charles](https://github.com/calcOSU), and [Kyle](https://github.com/Stac24/Flash-Card-Game).

Goal: Our goal was to gamify the learning experience of using flashcards. We aim to do this by awarding users 'stars' for completed games with a satisfactory score, as well as awarding 'rubies' for 2 day or more streaks.
