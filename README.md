## Goal: 

Our goal was to gamify the learning experience of using flashcards. We aim to do this by awarding users 'stars' for completed games with a satisfactory score, as well as awarding 'gems' for 2 day or more streaks.  
<br/>

## Quickstart:

```
git clone https://github.com/Stac24/Flash-Card-Game
cd Flash-Card-Game
```

## env configuration

Create a `.env` in the root folder i.e. `./Flash-Card-Game` and copy contents of `.env.dev` into it. 

Don't forget to create another `.env` in the React folder i.e. `./react-ui`
